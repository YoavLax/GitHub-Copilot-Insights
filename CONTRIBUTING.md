## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utilities

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind utility classes consistently
- Follow the existing glassmorphism design patterns
- Maintain the dark theme aesthetic
- Ensure responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### File Organization
- Place React components in `src/components/`
- Place utility functions in `src/utils/`
- Keep components focused (one component per file)
- Use descriptive file names matching component names
